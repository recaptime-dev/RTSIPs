This is the home of different RFCs for current and future squad members and the wider
Recap Time Squad community across the internet and in the universe (assuming humans gone
interstellar travel). This is also an public avenue for squad and community members to submit
proposals to improve or submit suggestions to different official documents
by Recap Time Squad, including our handbook, privacy policy and terms of service.

## Contributing to the RFC process

Our RFC process happens in the public, so you can participate in the process in different ways, including:

* **Authoring a new one or improving an exisiting RFC?** Most of the RFCs under
the final stages once merged (or their email patch been applied), can't be
amended other than grammar bug fixes only, so you might proceed with the RFC
creation process.
[Check the submission process for details](SUBMISSION.md) and make sure to
[review our CLA][RTSIP-8c08] (or [the Linux DCO][dco]
at your choice) before submitting as an GitLab merge request or email patch
via Sourcehut.
* **Discussing about the process or how to implement them?** You can discuss about
the RFC process and all the implementation
hellscapes on [our public inbox](https://go.rtapp.tk/lists/public-inbox) via sourcehut with prefix `[RFC]` to help other users
filter messages on their side and for visibility.

## Prior art

This RFC process is inspired by the following communities and their RFC process, specifically:

* [the fediverse community](https://activitypub.rocks) and [the Fediverse Enchancement Proposal](https://codeberg.org/fediverse/fep),
* [the Ethereum community](https://ethereum.org) and its [Ethereum Improvement Proposals](https://eips.ethereum.org/),
* and also [the Matrix spec](https://spec.matrix.org/latest/), although our
ActivityPub+Matrix implementation uses v1.3+ of the Matrix spec as of writing.
