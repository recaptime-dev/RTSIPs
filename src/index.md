# Recap Time Squad Improvement Proposals

RTSIPs are RFC-styled Standards Documents for codifying different aspects of the operational
workflows, internal, legal and community guildelines and other processes that would help shape
the squad handbook and other related documents, improve the overall community health and to
make things standardized across the board, among other things. While implementing these RTSIPs
within the organization could take some time due to limited time and human resources, everything

## RTSIP Status Types

* Idea - An idea that is pre-draft. This is not tracked within the RTSIP Repository, although can be
  tracked through the repository's issue tracker and discussed in the mailing list.
* Draft - The first formally tracked stage of a RTSIP in development. A RTSIP is merged by an
  EIP Editor into the EIP repository when properly formatted.
* Review - A RTSIP Author marks a RTSIP as ready for and requesting Peer Review.
* Legal Review Needed - A RTSIP Editor, usually a Squad Member, marks a RTSIP for possible legal issues,
  especially on the realms of any non-disclosure clauses, international laws, intellectual property
  and data privacy. This might also happen during Last Call.
* Last Call - This is the final review window for an RTSIP before moving to FINAL. An RTSIP editor
  will assign Last Call status and set a review end date (`last-call-deadline`), typically 14 days later.
  If this period results in necessary normative changes it will revert the EIP to Review.
* Final - This EIP represents the final standard. A Final EIP exists in a state of finality and should only be
  updated to correct errata and add non-normative clarifications.
* Stagnant - Any RTSIP in Draft or Review if inactive for a period of 6 months or greater is moved to Stagnant.
  An EIP may be resurrected from this state by Authors or EIP Editors through moving it back to Draft.
* Withdrawn - The RTSIP Author(s) have withdrawn the proposed EIP. This state has finality and can no longer be
  resurrected using this RTSIP ID. If the idea is pursued at later date it is considered a new proposal.
* Living - A special status for RTSIPs that are designed to be continually updated and not reach a state of finality.
  This includes most notably RTSIP-TBD.

## RTSIP Types

RTSIPs are separated into a number of types, and each has its own list of RTSIPs.

### [Standard](/standard)

Describe any chance that affects most of all of Recap Time Squad's projects, policies, processes and even its
community and legal organization, such as a change to the community guidelines, improving developer experience,
and even ammending it's organizational charter. Depending on how high the risk of implementing a new RTSIP, it
might either trigger a **Legal Review Needed**, a long Review period
